"<span style='color:#2c3e50;font-weight:bold;'>[Heart]</span> Define cardiac output and give normal resting value in an adult.","Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute, equal to heart rate times stroke volume. A typical resting value is about 5 liters per minute.","Heart"
"<span style='color:#2c3e50;font-weight:bold;'>[Heart]</span> Define preload, contractility, and afterload in relation to stroke volume.","Preload is the degree of stretch of ventricular muscle at the end of diastole. Contractility is the intrinsic strength of contraction at a given fiber length. Afterload is the pressure the ventricle must overcome to eject blood, mainly arterial pressure.","Heart"
"<span style='color:#2c3e50;font-weight:bold;'>[Heart]</span> How does increased venous return affect stroke volume according to the Frank Starling law?","Increased venous return increases end diastolic volume and stretches ventricular fibers, which increases force of contraction and stroke volume according to the Frank Starling law of the heart.","Heart"
"<span style='color:#2c3e50;font-weight:bold;'>[Heart]</span> How does sympathetic stimulation affect heart rate and contractility?","Sympathetic activity releases norepinephrine onto beta one receptors, increasing the rate of pacemaker depolarization and heart rate and increasing calcium entry into cardiac myocytes, which enhances contractility.","Heart"
"<span style='color:#2c3e50;font-weight:bold;'>[Heart]</span> Effect of parasympathetic vagal activity on heart rate and what is vagal tone?","Parasympathetic activity via the vagus nerve releases acetylcholine, which opens potassium channels and hyperpolarizes pacemaker cells, slowing heart rate. Vagal tone is the resting parasympathetic influence that maintains a typical resting heart rate around 75 beats per minute.","Heart"
