## Lecture 1: Basics; Origin of Eukaryotes

- Anatomy is the structure of the body.
- Physiology is function.
- Origin of eukaryotes:
  - Cells with a nucleus enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which separates genetic material from the rest of the cell.
  - Evolved from prokaryotes engulfed by phagocytosis.
  - Eukaryotes evolved an endomembrane system and unique biochemical pathways.
- Know the structure of a generalized cell.
- Know the function of organelles.

### Overview of Organelles and Their Functions
- Plasma membrane: selective barrier; regulates transport, signaling, and cell–cell interactions.
- Nucleus: stores DNA; site of transcription; nuclear envelope with pores controls traffic; nucleolus makes rRNA and assembles ribosomal subunits.
- Ribosomes: protein synthesis (translation); free ribosomes make cytosolic proteins; bound ribosomes (on RER) make secreted, membrane, and endomembrane proteins.
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER): synthesizes and begins processing of secreted/membrane proteins; initial glycosylation; protein folding and quality control.
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER): lipid and steroid synthesis; detoxification; carbohydrate metabolism; Ca2+ storage (sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle).
- Golgi apparatus: modifies (e.g., glycosylates), sorts, and packages proteins/lipids; cis→trans maturation; generates lysosomes and secretory vesicles.
- Lysosomes: acidic hydrolase-containing organelles for degradation of macromolecules; digest endocytosed material; autophagy of damaged organelles.
- Peroxisomes: oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids; detoxification; produce H2O2 and convert it to H2O via catalase.
- Mitochondria: ATP production via TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation; roles in apoptosis and Ca2+ buffering; contain their own DNA.
- Cytoskeleton:
  - Microfilaments (actin): cell shape, motility, cytokinesis; core of microvilli.
  - Intermediate filaments: tensile strength and structural support.
  - Microtubules: tracks for vesicle/organelle transport (kinesin/dynein), cilia/flagella, mitotic spindle.
- Centrosome/centrioles: microtubule-organizing center; forms spindle poles; centrioles can become basal bodies for cilia.
- Cilia/flagella: microtubule-based projections that move cells or propel fluid across epithelia.
- Endosomes: sorting hubs for endocytosed cargo; receptor recycling vs degradation (early → late endosome maturation).
- Secretory/transport vesicles: shuttle cargo between ER, Golgi, plasma membrane, and endosomes; mediate exocytosis.

## Lecture 2: Tissues and Epithelia

- 4 basic types of animal tissues.
- Multicellular organisms live longer because there is less stress on individual cells.
- Proliferation (know what that is).
- Differentiation (cells fulfilling different roles).
- Diffusion (know what that is) limits the maximum size of cells.
- Cells are organized into tissues.

### Epithelial Tissue (lines organs and cavities)

- Example of epithelial tissue: skin.
- Lacks blood or lymphatic support.
- Receives nourishment via diffusion from underlying connective tissue, through the basement membrane.
- Cell junctions are abundant (a cell junction is a class of cellular structures that provide cohesion between neighboring cells).
- The basement membrane sits below the epithelium.
- Two types: covering and lining; glandular.
- Most important function is to act as a selective barrier.
- Movement of substances across an epithelium is bidirectional.
- Shortly after birth, our intestines become colonized by bacteria.
- Special characteristics: polarity, specialized contacts, supported by connective tissues, avascular but innervated, ability to regenerate.

#### Polarity and Surfaces
- Apical surface: exposed to the outside or lumen.
- Basal surface: faces toward the body.
- Cancer can start with the loss of cell polarity.

#### Microvilli
- Function of microvilli on epithelial cells in the small intestine: increase absorption.
- Microvilli are microscopic cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area for diffusion.
- Brush-border epithelia have so much microvilli that the surface looks fuzzy like a paintbrush (adapted for absorption).

#### Cell Junctions
- Epithelial cells fit closely together using specialized contact points.
- Tight junctions prevent substances from leaking between cells.
- Adherens junctions mediate cell–cell adhesion.
- Desmosomes prevent cells from pulling apart in tissues subjected to mechanical stress.
- Gap junctions enable intercellular communication.
- Tight junctions and adherens junctions are on the apical side.
- Adherens junctions are usually more basal than tight junctions.

#### Support, Avascularity, and Regeneration
- All epithelia are supported by connective tissue and sit on a basement membrane, which helps resist stretching and tearing.
- Basement membrane consists of:
  - Basal lamina (layer of extracellular matrix/ECM proteins).
  - Reticular lamina (deep to basal lamina, network of collagen fibers).
- Epithelial cells are avascular.
- Nutrients and oxygen diffuse into the epithelial cell layer.
- Epithelial tissues can regenerate.
- When an epithelial cell dies, lack of polarity signals for new cells to replace it.

#### Intestinal Epithelium Stem Cell Niche
- Enterocytes (intestinal absorptive cells) are generated in a stem cell niche composed of crypt-based columnar (CBC) cells and flanking PC cells found in the crypts at the base of each villus.
- These CBC cells undergo asymmetric cell division: a new stem cell plus a committed daughter cell.

#### Classification
- Simple epithelia: one layer. Stratified epithelia: two or more layers.
- Shapes: squamous (flat), cuboidal (cube-like), columnar (tall).
- Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: single layer with differing cell heights; all cells contact the basement membrane.
- Stratified epithelia can have different shapes in different layers; categorized by the shape of the apical layer.

#### Specific Types

- Simple squamous epithelium:
  - Cells are flattened laterally; cytoplasm is sparse.
  - Found where filtration or rapid diffusion is a priority (kidney, lungs).
  - Two special types:
    1. Endothelium (lining of lymphatic vessels, blood vessels, heart). Derived from ectoderm and endoderm in early embryo.
    2. Mesothelium (serous membranes in the ventral body cavity). Visceral layer covers the outside of organs; parietal layer lines the body cavity. Derived from mesoderm in early embryo. Fluid between the two layers allows organs to slide without friction.

- Simple cuboidal epithelium:
  - Single layer of cube-like cells with large, spherical central nuclei.
  - Functions in secretion and absorption.
  - Found in kidney tubules, ducts and secretory portions of small glands, and on the ovary surface.
  - Ciliated simple cuboidal epithelium is found in the bronchioles of the lungs and uterine tubes.
  - Bronchioles are the small airways in the lungs that lead from the bronchi to the alveoli.
  - Cilia move mucus and debris out of the lungs.
  - Scattered goblet cells secrete mucus that traps debris.

- Simple columnar epithelium:
  - Single layer of tall cells with round to oval nuclei.
  - Lines the digestive tract from stomach to rectum, gallbladder, and excretory ducts of some glands.
  - Functions in absorption and secretion of mucus, enzymes, and other substances.
  - Secretory cells are often goblet cells, which produce mucus. Goblet cells secrete mucus into the digestive tract.
  - Some are ciliated (small bronchi, uterine tubes, some regions of the uterus).

- Pseudostratified columnar epithelium:
  - Single layer of differing cell heights; all contact the basement membrane.
  - Can be ciliated (respiratory tract) or non-ciliated (sperm-carrying ducts).
  - Goblet cells may be present and secrete mucus.

- Stratified squamous epithelium:
  - Thick membrane with several layers; basal cells are cuboidal or columnar and metabolically active; surface cells are flattened (squamous).
  - Keratinized type: surface cells are full of keratin and dead (e.g., skin).
  - Cells are replaced from below (basal layer).
  - Most common stratified epithelium; found on the surface of the skin and the lining of the mouth and esophagus.
  - Name comes from the most apical layer.
  - Non-keratinized type forms the moist linings of the esophagus, mouth, and vagina.

- Stratified cuboidal epithelium:
  - Rare; found in some sweat and mammary glands.
  - Typically two layers of cuboidal cells.
  - Functions in protection and secretion.

- Stratified columnar epithelium:
  - Not ciliated; basal layers are usually cuboidal.
  - Found in the male urethra, pharynx, and lining some glandular ducts.

- Transitional epithelium:
  - Special type of stratified epithelium found in the urinary bladder, ureters, and part of the urethra.
  - Functions as a permeable barrier to prevent diffusion of potentially toxic urine into underlying tissues; very resistant to osmotic pressure.
  - Protected from drying out by uroplakins (specialized proteins).
  - Number of layers changes with degree of stretch (e.g., when the bladder fills).

#### Glandular Epithelium
- A gland is one or more cells that makes and secretes an aqueous fluid called a secretion.
- Classified by site of product release (endocrine or exocrine—to a lumen or the outside of the body) and number of cells (unicellular or multicellular).
- Unicellular glands like goblet cells are scattered in epithelial sheets.
- Most multicellular glands form during development by inward growth (invagination) of an epithelial sheet into the underlying connective tissue.
- Exocrine glands keep ducts that transport the secretion to the epithelial surface.
- Endocrine glands lose their ducts during development and secrete hormones into the interstitial fluid, which is picked up by the circulatory system.
- Endocrine glands are highly vascularized.
- Exocrine glands include sweat glands, oil glands, salivary glands, ceruminous glands, lacrimal glands, sebaceous glands, digestive glands, pancreas, and liver.
- Two important unicellular exocrine glands: goblet cells and mucous cells.
- Both secrete mucin (a highly glycosylated protein that forms mucus in water).
- Multicellular exocrine glands are classified by structure (simple or compound) and shape of the secretory unit (tubular, alveolar, or tubuloalveolar).
- Modes of secretion:
  - Merocrine: secreted by exocytosis (e.g., pancreas, sweat glands, salivary glands).
  - Holocrine: cells accumulate products until they rupture (e.g., sebaceous glands).
  - Apocrine: the apex of the cell pinches off with secretory granules; the cell repairs itself and repeats (e.g., mammary glands; associated with hairy regions like armpits and genital area).

## Lecture 3: Connective Tissue

### Overview
- Four main classes: connective tissue proper, cartilage, bone, blood.
- Major functions: binding and support, protection, insulation, transportation (blood).
- All connective tissues come from mesoderm.
- Varying degrees of vascularity (cartilage is avascular; dense connective tissue is poorly vascularized; other types have a rich blood supply).
- Cells are suspended/embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM).
- Three main components: ground substance, fibers, cells.

### ECM: Ground Substance and Fibers
- Ground substance: unstructured material filling space between cells; contains interstitial fluid, cell adhesion proteins, and proteoglycans (protein core + large polysaccharides).
- Fibers:
  - Collagen: strongest and most abundant; tough; provides high tensile strength.
  - Elastic: long, thin fibers that allow for stretch; made of elastin; stretch and recoil like rubber bands.
  - Reticular: short, fine, highly branched collagenous fibers (collagen III); offer more “give”; form delicate networks that cover and support bordering structures.
- Collagen forms a triple helix of 3 identical alpha chains.
- Proteins that stick out of cells can be considered part of the ECM.
- Ground substance + fibers = ECM.

### Cells
- “Blast” cells: immature, actively secrete ground substance and ECM fibers.
  - Fibroblasts (connective tissue proper).
  - Chondroblasts (cartilage).
  - Osteoblasts (bone).
  - Hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow).
- Mature cells (suffix “-cyte”) are less active in secreting ECM.
- Other cells: fat cells, white blood cells, mast cells (initiate local inflammatory response), macrophages (phagocytic; activate immune system).

### Connective Tissue Proper

- Subclasses: loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue.

#### Loose Connective Tissue
- Types: areolar, adipose, reticular.

- Areolar connective tissue:
  - Fibroblasts; loose arrangement of mostly collagen fibers and some elastic fibers.
  - Increased ground substance acts as a reservoir for water and salts (interstitial fluid).
  - Almost all cells get nutrients from and release wastes into this tissue fluid.
  - Most widely distributed connective tissue.
  - Universal packing material between other tissues.
  - Found surrounding capillaries, muscles, organs.
  - Fills spaces between organs; forms the lamina propria of mucous membranes.
  - Macrophages and fat cells can be present.

- Adipose tissue:
  - Similar to areolar but with more nutrient-storing ability; very little matrix.
  - Adipocytes account for ~90% of mass; nucleus pushed to the side by a large fat droplet.
  - Richly vascularized.
  - Functions: nutrient storage, shock absorption, insulation, protection.
  - Locations: under skin (subcutaneous fat), around kidneys and eyeballs, within abdomen (visceral fat), in breasts.
  - Types:
    - White fat: stores nutrients; shock absorber and insulator.
    - Brown fat: uses lipid fuels to heat bloodstream (not to produce ATP); found in babies and children; brown due to many mitochondria; helps newborns maintain body temperature.

- Reticular connective tissue:
  - Resembles areolar, but only reticular fibers in the matrix (no collagen or elastic fibers).
  - Fibroblasts are called reticular cells.
  - Cells secrete reticular fibers made of thin collagen.
  - Thin fibers form a mesh-like stroma (supportive framework) that supports blood cells in lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.
  - Reticular fibers also occur in other connective tissues.
  - Provides a soft bedding for cells.

#### Dense Connective Tissue
- Contains more collagen than loose connective tissue.
- Types: dense regular and dense irregular (and dense regular elastic connective tissue).

- Dense regular connective tissue:
  - Closely packed bundles of collagen running in the same direction, parallel to direction of pull.
  - Flexible structures with high tensile strength.
  - Resists stretch but can stretch a little due to crimped collagen fibers; once straightened, little additional stretch.
  - Rows of fibroblasts between collagen fibers manufacture fiber building blocks; few cells relative to collagen.
  - Forms tendons (muscle to bone), ligaments (bone to bone), aponeuroses (muscle to muscle or muscle to bone).
  - Tendons: fibrous cords connecting muscle to bone.
  - Ligaments: short bands connecting bone to bone.
  - Aponeuroses: flat, sheetlike tendons.
  - Poorly vascularized; healing is slow.
  - Very little turnover of collagen fibers after ~17/18 years of age.

- Dense irregular connective tissue:
  - Bundles of collagen are thicker and irregularly arranged; fibers form sheets rather than bundles.
  - Greater strength in all directions, less in any single direction than dense regular.
  - Fibers can crisscross to form a mesh.
  - Found where tension is exerted from many directions.
  - Locations: dermis of skin, fibrous joint capsules, fibrous coverings of some organs (kidney, bone, cartilage, muscles, nerves); forms the fibrous layer of the perichondrium.

- Dense regular elastic connective tissue:
  - Modified dense regular connective tissue with a high proportion of elastic fibers.
  - Elastic fibers allow recoil after stretching.
  - Walls of the lungs and large arteries stretch and recoil; certain ligaments connecting adjacent vertebrae are very elastic.

### Cartilage
- Types: hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage.
- Firm but flexible; avascular.
- ~80% water; packed with collagen fibers and sugar proteins (chondroitin and hyaluronic acid).
- Chondroblasts secrete matrix in developing cartilage.
- In adults, chondrocytes (mature chondroblasts) lie in lacunae in the matrix they made.

- Hyaline cartilage:
  - Most abundant; translucent with bluish-white glassy appearance.
  - Many collagen fibers; firm.
  - Found at the tip of the nose, supports respiratory passages, covers ends of long bones as articular cartilage, connects ribs to sternum, and makes up most of the embryonic skeleton.
  - Articular cartilage covers bone ends at joints.
  - During childhood, epiphyseal plates (growth plates) are hyaline cartilage that allows growth of long bones.

- Elastic cartilage:
  - More elastic fibers than hyaline; more flexible.
  - Found in the external ear and epiglottis.

- Fibrocartilage:
  - Highly compressible with great tensile strength; strongest type.
  - Found in menisci of the knee and intervertebral discs.

### Bone
- Living tissue; vascularized; composed mainly of collagen fibers and inorganic calcium salts.
- Hardness is due to inorganic calcium salts.
- Compact bone (outer layer) and spongy bone (inside).
- This bone matrix is organized into structural units called osteoids.
- Osteoid is the unmineralized bone matrix, formed prior to maturation of bone tissue; composed of collagen fibers and ground substance.
- Soon after osteoid forms, calcium salts are deposited on and around it, hardening the matrix.
- Functions: support, protection, movement, mineral storage (calcium and phosphorus), blood cell formation (hematopoiesis in red marrow of certain bones).
- Cells: osteoblasts (bone-forming), osteocytes (mature), osteoclasts (bone-resorbing).

### Blood
- Does not support or connect tissues; functions as an internal transportation system for nutrients, wastes, gases, and other substances.
- Classified as connective tissue because it develops from mesenchyme and consists of blood cells surrounded by a nonliving fluid matrix called blood plasma.
- Cells: red blood cells (erythrocytes, transport oxygen), white blood cells (leukocytes, immune response), platelets (cell fragments involved in clotting).
- Fibers are soluble proteins that precipitate during blood clotting.

## Lecture 4: Plasma Membrane and Transport

### Structure and Components
- The plasma membrane is a flexible membrane that separates the intracellular fluid (ICF) from the extracellular fluid (ECF).
- Highly selective barrier that maintains the cellular environment.
- Composed of a lipid bilayer arranged into a hollow sphere.
- The lipid bilayer consists mostly of phospholipids, with some cholesterol and glycolipids.
- Phospholipid heads are hydrophilic (face water); tails are hydrophobic (face inward).
- ~5% of membrane lipids are glycolipids (lipids with sugar groups on the polar head).
- ~20% of membrane lipids are cholesterol (polar hydroxyl + nonpolar fused rings).
- Cholesterol decreases membrane fluidity and increases stability.
- Cholesterol forms specialized lipid islands (lipid rafts) where signaling molecules congregate.
- Phospholipids are amphipathic.
- Selective permeability results from bilayer structure.
- Impermeable to most water-soluble molecules (glucose, proteins, ions).
- The bilayer is fluid, not solid; unsaturated fatty acids increase fluidity.
- Phospholipids and proteins move laterally; proteins do not flip across the membrane.

### Proteins and the Fluid Mosaic Model
- While lipids are structural, proteins determine most specific functions.
- Roughly 1 protein molecule per 50–100 lipid molecules.
- Fluid mosaic model: fluid bilayer with a mosaic of proteins.
- Integral proteins: embedded; many are transmembrane; have hydrophobic regions (nonpolar amino acids) and hydrophilic regions (polar/charged amino acids).
- Peripheral proteins: loosely attached to integral proteins or polar heads; include cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., spectrin in RBCs) and enzymes.
- Some membrane proteins are anchored to the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix, restricting movement (and this can be regulated).
- Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is used to study protein movement.

### Protein Functions
- Transport (channels, carriers; some use ATP to pump solutes).
- Enzymatic activity.
- Receptors for signal transduction.
- Attachment to cytoskeleton and ECM.
- Cell–cell adhesion.
- Cell–cell recognition.

### Glycocalyx and Recognition
- Carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins and glycolipids form the glycocalyx (sugary coating).
- Composition is unique to cell types; functions as a biological marker for recognition.
- Bacteria have their own glycocalyx aiding adhesion and immune evasion.

### Membrane Transport: Passive vs Active
- Passive processes: driven by kinetic energy; no ATP (e.g., diffusion).
- Active processes: require ATP (e.g., active transport).

#### Diffusion
- Molecules move from high to low concentration (down the gradient).

- Simple diffusion:
  - Diffuse directly through lipid bilayer.
  - Small, nonpolar, lipid-soluble molecules (O2, CO2, steroid hormones, fat-soluble vitamins).

- Facilitated diffusion:
  - Carrier-mediated: transmembrane protein changes shape to move molecules (e.g., glucose, amino acids, some ions); passive; generally slower than channel-mediated.
  - Channel-mediated: selective channels for specific ions/molecules; leakage (always open) or gated (chemical/electrical signals).

#### Osmosis
- Diffusion of a solvent (water) through a selectively permeable membrane.
- Occurs when solute concentrations differ across the membrane.

- Cases:
  - Membrane permeable to both solute and solvent: both move down gradients to equilibrium; volumes unchanged.
  - Membrane permeable to solvent but not solute: solvent moves down its gradient; volumes change.

- Osmotic pressure: pressure required to prevent osmosis; increases with solute concentration.
- Only nonpenetrating solutes (large molecules, ions) contribute to osmotic pressure.
- Osmolarity: total concentration of all solute particles (penetrating + nonpenetrating).
- Tonicity: concentration of nonpenetrating solutes relative to the cell.

- Key points:
  - Major nonpenetrating solutes in the body: Na+, Cl−, proteins.
  - Body fluids ~300 mOsm.
  - Example: 1 L solution of 300 mOsm NaCl (nonpenetrating) + 100 mOsm urea (penetrating) is hyperosmotic (400 mOsm) but isotonic to a cell (nonpenetrating = 300 mOsm).

- Cell responses:
  - Isotonic: cells retain normal size/shape.
  - Hypertonic: cells lose water and shrink (crenate).
  - Hypotonic: cells take on water and may burst (lyse).

## Lecture 5: Membrane Transport Mechanisms

### Carrier-Mediated Transport
- Shape changes are conformational changes.
- Rate depends on:
  - Steepness of the concentration gradient.
  - Number of carrier proteins.
  - Rate of conformational change.
- Types:
  - Facilitated diffusion (passive).
  - Active transport (requires ATP).

### Active Transport
- Primary active transport:
  - Energy comes directly from ATP hydrolysis.
  - Example: Na+/K+ ATPase pumps 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in per ATP.
  - Establishes and maintains Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients.
  - Maintains low Na+ and high K+ inside; high Na+ and low K+ outside.
  - Establishes gradients used for secondary active transport.
  - Consumes ~10–40% of cellular energy.

- Secondary active transport:
  - Uses energy stored in an electrochemical gradient to drive other solutes.
  - Transporters have binding sites for the ion (usually Na+) and the cotransported molecule.
  - Symporters move both in the same direction; antiporters move them in opposite directions.
  - Na+ moves down its gradient into the cell, providing energy to move the cotransported molecule against its gradient.

### Vesicular (Bulk) Transport
- Transports large particles, macromolecules, and fluids in vesicles; requires ATP.
- Endocytosis (into the cell), exocytosis (out of the cell), transcytosis (into, across, and out).

- Endocytosis:
  - Material is enclosed in a protein-coated vesicle.
  - Types:
    - Phagocytosis (“cell eating”): large particles engulfed by pseudopods into a phagosome; often fuses with lysosome; used by some white blood cells.
    - Pinocytosis (“cell drinking”): extracellular fluid and dissolved solutes taken into tiny vesicles.
      - Micropinosomes are smaller than macropinosomes.
      - Macropinocytosis is a primary source of nutrient uptake in some cells (e.g., small intestine).
      - Plasma membrane invaginates; macropinosome ~equal to ~100 small clathrin-mediated vesicles.
      - Filling is usually nonselective, allowing sampling of extracellular fluid.
      - In mammalian cells, macropinocytosis is activated by growth factors.
      - In malignant cells, macropinocytosis is often upregulated to provide extra nutrients.
      - Viruses and bacteria can enter via macropinocytosis (e.g., Vaccinia virus).
    - Receptor-mediated endocytosis: selective uptake of specific molecules (enzymes, hormones, LDL, iron).
      - Ligands bind specific membrane receptors, triggering protein-coated vesicle formation.
      - Clathrin-coated vesicles are the most well-known type (e.g., ingest enzymes, LDL, iron, insulin).
      - Caveolae: clathrin-independent, flask-shaped invaginations rich in caveolins and cavins; located in lipid rafts enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids; abundant in smooth muscle, endothelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells; capture specific molecules (integrins, folic acid, tetanus toxin).

- Exocytosis:
  - Used to eject substances from the cell.
  - Steps:
    1. Membrane-bound vesicle migrates to the plasma membrane.
    2. Vesicle proteins (v-SNAREs) bind plasma membrane proteins (t-SNAREs).
    3. Membranes fuse and a pore opens.
    4. Vesicle contents are released outside the cell.

### Signal Transduction and GPCRs
- Signal transduction: transmission of information from outside to inside the cell.
- Receptors initiate intracellular signaling cascades upon ligand binding.

- G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs):
  - Largest family of cell-surface receptors (>800).
  - Orphan GPCRs have unknown ligands.
  - Seven transmembrane domains.
  - Interact with G proteins in the plasma membrane.
  - Ligand binding causes a conformational change that activates the G protein by exchanging GDP for GTP.
  - G proteins bind GTP and GDP.
  - Heterotrimeric G proteins have alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.

## Fundamentals of the Nervous System

### Overview
- The human brain weighs about 3 pounds and is ~77% water.
- There are ~100 billion neurons, each with ~10,000 synaptic connections.
- A neuron is the basic functional unit of the nervous system.
- It receives input from other neurons via dendrites and sends output via its axon.
- A neuron has a single axon that can branch, sending collateral signals to multiple cells.
- Axon terminals form synapses with target cells and release neurotransmitters.

### Divisions of the Nervous System
- Central nervous system (CNS): brain and spinal cord.
- Peripheral nervous system (PNS): divided into somatic and autonomic nervous systems.
  - Somatic nervous system: controls voluntary movements via skeletal muscles; composed of 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerves; contains both sensory and motor neurons; single-neuron system.
  - Autonomic nervous system (ANS): controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate; two-neuron system with a preganglionic neuron in the CNS and a postganglionic neuron in the PNS; divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

### Excitable Cells and Neurons
- All cells have a membrane potential generated by ATPase, which creates unequal ion distribution across the membrane.
- Neurons and muscle cells are excitable and conduct action potentials along their membranes.
- They have ion channels that other cells do not have.
- The shape and size of a neuron's dendritic arbor indicate its function.
- Neurons are post-mitotic (cannot divide), have a high metabolic rate, and require a constant supply of oxygen and glucose.
- The brain is the most energy-consuming organ in the body.

### Neuronal Structure
- Neuron cell body (soma or perikaryon).
- Spherical nucleus with a prominent nucleolus.
- Nissl bodies: large granular bodies of rough ER and ribosomes.
- Nuclei: neuron cell bodies in the CNS (gray matter).
- Ganglia: clusters of neuron cell bodies in the PNS.
- Parkinson's disease is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.
- Two types of processes extend from the soma: many dendrites and one axon.
- CNS contains cell bodies and processes.
- PNS contains mainly neuron processes bundled into nerves.
- Within the CNS, axons are bundled in tracts (white matter).
- Dendrites receive communications and contain many of the same organelles as cell bodies.
- Dendritic spines are small projections on dendrites that receive input from axons.
- The axon hillock is a cone-shaped area where the axon leaves the soma.
- The axon conducts electrical signals away from the cell body; it can be short or long and can branch to form axon collaterals.
- At their distal ends, axons branch to form synaptic terminals (terminal boutons).
- Axons conduct impulses in one direction along the axolemma to the axon terminal, where neurotransmitters are secreted.
- An axon generally has few organelles, so its constituent proteins and membrane lipids are renewed from cargo delivered in vesicles transported from the soma.

### Glial Cells
- Glial cells constitute about half the volume of the CNS; they surround the soma, axon, and dendrites and provide physical and metabolic support.
- Oligodendrocytes (CNS): form myelin sheaths in the CNS. Myelin is a whitish, protein-lipid substance that insulates axons and increases conduction speed. One oligodendrocyte can myelinate ~1 mm of multiple axons.
- Multiple sclerosis (MS): autoimmune disease characterized by loss of CNS myelin; demyelinated axons conduct more slowly and may degenerate.
- Schwann cells (PNS): myelinate axons in the PNS. One Schwann cell myelinates ~1 mm of a single axon; vital to regeneration of damaged peripheral nerve fibers.
- Non-myelinating Schwann cells surround small-diameter axons in the PNS.

### Axonal Transport
- Anterograde transport (soma → axon terminal): transports mitochondria, cytoskeletal elements, membrane components, enzymes, and neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.
- Retrograde transport (axon terminal → soma): transports membrane vesicles (for recycling) and materials to be degraded; also transports some viruses and toxins (tetanus, rabies, herpes simplex).
- Both directions use motor proteins (kinesins and dyneins) that “walk” along microtubules.
  - Kinesins: anterograde transport.
  - Dyneins: retrograde transport.

### Nernst Equation
- The Nernst equation calculates the equilibrium potential (Eion) for a particular ion.
- Eion = (61/z) * log([ion]outside/[ion]inside)

### Resting Membrane Potential
- A voltmeter measures a potential difference across the membrane of a resting neuron of about −70 mV.
- ECF is assigned a value of 0 mV.
- Resting membrane voltages range from −50 to −100 mV in different cells.
- Membrane potential is determined by:
  - Differences in ionic composition of ICF and ECF.
  - Differential permeability of the plasma membrane to those ions.

### Charge Separation Across the Membrane
- Voltage occurs only at the membrane surface; bulk solutions on both sides are electrically neutral.
- A small excess of negative charges groups on the inner face and a corresponding positive charge on the outer face.
- The membrane acts as a capacitor, separating and storing opposite charges.
- Leak channels (not ligand-gated) are selective ion channels that are always open.
- Neurons have many more K+ leak channels than Na+ leak channels, bringing membrane voltage toward the K+ equilibrium potential (−90 mV).
- Changes in K+ concentration have the greatest effect on resting membrane potential.

### Gated Ion Channels and Potentials
- Chemically gated (ligand-gated) channels open when the appropriate chemical binds.
- Voltage-gated channels open in response to changes in membrane potential.
- Mechanically gated channels open in response to physical deformation (touch, pressure, vibration).
- Depolarization: decrease in membrane potential (toward zero and above).
- Hyperpolarization: increase in membrane potential (farther from zero).
- Graded potentials: short-lived, localized changes in membrane potential; triggered by stimuli that open gated ion channels; magnitude varies with stimulus strength.
  - Receptor potential: in sensory receptors.
  - Postsynaptic potential: in dendrites or soma of a neuron or muscle cell.
- Action potentials: brief reversal of membrane potential with a total amplitude of ~100 mV; do not decay with distance; principal means of neural communication; occur only in muscle cells and axons of neurons; involve opening of specific voltage-gated channels.
- Threshold potential: membrane potential at which an action potential is triggered (usually −55 to −50 mV).

## Lecture 6: Synapses

- A synapse is a junction that mediates information transfer from one neuron to another or from a neuron to an effector cell (muscle or gland).
- Two types - electrical (gap junctions) and chemical.
- Electrical synapses are very quick.
- The presynaptic terminal contains synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter.
- Chemical synapses are specialized for the release and reception of chemical neurotransmitters.
- The synaptic cleft is a fluid-filled space separating the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes.
- The postsynaptic terminal contains receptor regions for neurotransmitters.
- Common neurotransmitters: glutamate and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid).
  - Glutamate is excitatory.
  - GABA and glycine are inhibitory.
- Two main types of glutamate receptors: AMPAR and NMDA.
  - When glutamate binds AMPAR, it opens a cation channel allowing Na+ influx and K+ efflux, causing a small depolarization called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).
- GABA can bind to two receptor types:
  - GABA_A: ligand-gated chloride channel; GABA binding opens the channel and Cl− influx causes an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).
  - GABA_B: uses signaling proteins to signal elsewhere in the cell.
- Axodendritic synapse: axon to dendrite.
- Axosomatic synapse: axon to soma.
- Axoaxonic synapse: axon to axon.
- Chemical signaling is unidirectional; some electrical synapses are bidirectional.
- Dendritic spines are small, mushroom-shaped projections from dendrites that receive input from single axons at synapses.
- Axon initial segment (AIS) is the first part of the axon and is where action potentials are initiated.

### Modulation of Synaptic Transmission
- Increased Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal increases neurotransmitter release.
- The growth cone is a dynamic, actin-supported extension of a developing or regenerating neurite seeking its synaptic target.
- Filopodia are thin, actin-rich protrusions that extend from the growth cone of a developing axon.

## Lecture 7A: Skeletal Muscle

- Largest tissue by weight; ~640 muscles in the human body.
- Mammals have three kinds of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth.
- Skeletal muscle: elongated cells (muscle fibers), peripheral nuclei, striated, voluntary.
- Cardiac muscle: only in the heart; striated; involuntary; intercalated discs; branching cells.
- Smooth muscle: spindle-shaped cells; nonstriated; involuntary.
- Muscle cells (fibers) are grouped into fascicles and surrounded by connective tissue.
- Contractile cells shorten to exert force.
- Epimysium: dense irregular connective tissue surrounding the entire muscle.
- Perimysium: fibrous connective tissue surrounding each fascicle.
- Endomysium: fine areolar connective tissue surrounding each muscle fiber; electrically insulates fibers from each other.
- A mature muscle cell is a long tube called a myofiber.
- Numerous mitochondria; many nuclei.
- Myonuclei are located just beneath the sarcolemma (plasma membrane).
- Muscle fibers do not divide; postnatal growth is by hypertrophy (increase in size).
- Transverse (T) tubules extend into the cytoplasm and surround myofibrils; carry the action potential deep into the cell.
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is specialized smooth ER that stores and releases calcium; releases Ca2+ when prompted by T tubules.
- Actin vs myosin: actin (thin filament), myosin (thick filament).
- Z disc: coin-shaped sheet of proteins that anchors thin filaments and connects myofibrils.
- Sarcomere: smallest contractile unit; region between two successive Z discs.

### Structure of Myofilaments
- Thin filaments are primarily actin.
- Actin is a globular protein (G-actin) that polymerizes to form long chains (F-actin).
- Two F-actin strands twist into a helix to form the thin filament.
- Tropomyosin: rod-shaped protein that spirals around the actin core and helps stiffen it.
- Troponin: globular protein with three subunits:
  - TnI: binds actin.
  - TnT: binds tropomyosin.
  - TnC: binds calcium ions.
- Thick filaments are primarily myosin; each myosin has a rod-like tail and two globular heads (like two golf clubs twisted together).

### Sliding Filament Model of Contraction
- In a relaxed state, thin and thick filaments overlap only slightly.
- During contraction, thin filaments slide past thick filaments, increasing overlap.
- Myosin heads bind to actin, detach, and bind again to propel thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere.
- Bands and zones:
  - I band (light): only thin filaments; bisected by the Z disc.
  - A band (dark): entire length of thick filaments.
  - H zone: lighter region in the middle of the A band where there are no thin filaments.
  - M line: dark line in the middle of the H zone that holds thick filaments together.
- Length–tension relationship: tension and force of contraction depend on initial muscle length; optimal resting length yields maximum force.

- Cross-bridge cycle:
  1. The myosin head has ATP bound (low-energy configuration).
  2. The myosin head hydrolyzes ATP to ADP + Pi (high-energy configuration; ~90° to thin filament).
  3. Energized myosin binds actin, forming a cross-bridge.
  4. Power stroke: thin filament moves toward the sarcomere center; ADP + Pi are released.

### Ca2+ Regulation of Contraction
- Powered by ATP but triggered by Ca2+.
- A triad is a T tubule and two terminal cisterns of the SR.
- The action potential travels from the sarcolemma down T tubules. The voltage-sensing portion of the DHP receptor changes conformation and mechanically pulls on the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in the SR membrane, opening a channel and allowing Ca2+ to flow out of the SR into the cytoplasm.
- In resting muscle, cytoplasmic Ca2+ is very low (~0.1 µM).
- Myosin-binding sites on actin are blocked by tropomyosin, preventing cross-bridge formation.
- Ca2+ released from the SR binds troponin C, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from myosin-binding sites on actin.
- Contraction ends when Ca2+ is pumped back into the SR by the Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA).
- SERCAs maintain the low cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in resting muscle.

### Roles of ATP in Muscle Contraction
1. ATP hydrolysis energizes the cross-bridge (powers the power stroke).
2. ATP binding disconnects the myosin head from actin after the power stroke.
3. ATP powers the Ca2+ ATPase that pumps Ca2+ back into the SR.
- After death, ATP production stops but ATP is still needed for relaxation. Rigor mortis occurs because cross-bridges cannot detach from actin without ATP.

## Lecture 7B: More Skeletal Muscle

- Skeletal muscles are innervated by somatic motor neurons.
- NMJ: point of contact between a somatic motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber.
- Each fiber is innervated by a single motor neuron.
- Each motor neuron can innervate multiple muscle fibers.
- The neuromuscular junction is almost always located midway along the length of the muscle fiber.

### The Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)
- Axonal ending: synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine (ACh).
- Motor end plate: specialized sarcolemma region with numerous folds and ACh receptors.
- Separated by the synaptic cleft.
- nAChRs are concentrated at the crests of postsynaptic folds.
- Role of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) at the NMJ:
  - ACh released from the axon terminal binds to nAChRs on the motor end plate.
  - nAChRs are ligand-gated cation channels that open when two ACh molecules bind.
  - Na+ influx and K+ efflux occur, but more Na+ enters than K+ leaves, causing a local depolarization called the end plate potential (EPP).
  - The EPP triggers an action potential that spreads over the muscle surface and into T tubules.
  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the synaptic cleft breaks down ACh to terminate the signal.

- Steps:
  1. Action potential is propagated along the sarcolemma and down T tubules.
  2. Action potential triggers Ca2+ release from terminal cisterns of the SR.
  3. Calcium ions bind troponin, allowing actin–myosin binding.
  4. Contraction begins: cross-bridges cycle, pulling actin toward the sarcomere center; ATP hydrolysis powers the cycle.
  5. Removal of Ca2+ by active transport into the SR after the action potential ends.
  6. Tropomyosin re-covers actin active sites; contraction ends and the fiber relaxes.

### Phases of a Muscle Twitch
- Latent phase: sarcolemma and T tubules depolarize; Ca2+ released from SR.
- Contraction phase: Ca2+ binds troponin; cross-bridge cycling occurs; tension builds to a peak.
- Relaxation phase: Ca2+ reabsorbed into SR by SERCA; myosin-binding sites re-covered by tropomyosin; tension returns to zero.

### Motor Units
- A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all muscle fibers it innervates.
- When a motor neuron fires, all fibers in its motor unit contract.

- Hypotonia: decreased muscle tone.
- Hypertonia: increased muscle tone.

### Types of Muscle Contractions
- Tension: force exerted on an object by a contracting muscle.
- Isometric contraction: muscle length remains the same while tension increases.
- Isotonic contraction: muscle changes length while maintaining tension.
  - Concentric: muscle shortens while generating force.
  - Eccentric: muscle lengthens while maintaining force.
- Eccentric contraction produces delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).

### ATP Synthesis in Muscle
- When ATP supplies are low, muscles generate ATP via:
  1. Direct phosphorylation of ADP by creatine phosphate (CP).
  2. Anaerobic pathway: glycolysis and lactic acid formation.
  3. Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (aerobic respiration).

### Fast Twitch Muscle Fibers
- Fast glycolytic (FG) fibers: large diameter; few mitochondria; few capillaries; low myoglobin; white color; anaerobic glycolysis; rapid fatigue.
- Obtain most ATP from glycolysis (white fibers).

### Slow Twitch Muscle Fibers
- Slow oxidative (SO) fibers: small diameter; many mitochondria; many capillaries; high myoglobin; red color; aerobic respiration; slow to fatigue (red fibers).

### Intermediate Fibers
- Fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) fibers: intermediate diameter; many mitochondria; many capillaries; high myoglobin; red to pink color; aerobic respiration and glycolysis; moderate resistance to fatigue.
