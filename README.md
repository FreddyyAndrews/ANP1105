\- proliferation (know what that is)

\- Differentiation (cells fulfilling different roles)

\- Diffusion (know what that is) limits the maximum size of cells



\- cells are organized into tissues

**- epithelial tissue (lines organs and cavaties)**

* example of epithelial tissue is skin
* lacks blood or lymph support
* receives nourishment via diffuson from underlying connective tissue, through the basement membrane
* \- cell junctions are abundant (a cell junction is a class of cellularstrucutes that provide cohesion between neighboring cells)
*  basement membrane sits below the epithelium
* epithelial tissue comes in 2 flavours - covering and lining, glandular
* \- most important function is to act as a selective barrier
* movement of substances across an epithelium is bi directional
* shortly after birth our intestines become colonized by bateria
* special characteristics of epithelial tissue (polarity, specialized contacts, supported by connective tissues, avascular, but innervated, ability to regenerate)
* Polarity: apical surface (exposed to the outside or lumen), basal surface (faces toward body), cancer can start with the loss of cell polarity
* What is the function of microvilli on epithelial cells in the small intestine? (increase absorption)
* Microvilli is microscopic cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area for diffusion
* Brush bordered epithelia has so much microvilli that the surface looks fuzzy like a paint brush(adapted for absorption)
* Epithelial cells need to fit closely together, using specialized contact points
* Tight junctions prevents substances from leaking between cells
* Adherens junctions mediate cell-cell adhesion
* desmosomes prevent cells from pulling apart in tissues subjected to mechanical stress
* gap junctions (intercellular communication)
* tight juctions and adherence junctions on the apical side (outside)
* adherence junctions are usually more basal than tight junctions
* all epithelial are supported by connective tissue and sit on basement membrane which helps it resists stretching and tearing
* basement membrane consists of basal lamina (layer of extracellular matrix/ ECM proteins) and reticuylar lamina (deep to basal lamina, network of collagen fibers)
* epithelial cells are avascular
* nutrients and oxygen diffuse into the epithelial cell layer
* epithelial tissues can regenerate
* when epithelial cell dies lack of polarity signals for new cells to replace it
* In the intestinal epithelium enterocytes (intestinal absorption cells) are generated in stem cell niche composed on crypt based columnar (CBC cells) and flanking PC cells found in the crypts at the base of each villis
* these cbc cells undergo asymmetric cell division, new stem cell plus committed daughter cell
* simple epithelia is one layer, stratified epithelia is two or more layers
* squamous is flat, cuboidal is cube, columnar is tall
* Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is a single layer of cells of differing heights, some not reaching the free surface, but all cells contact the basement membrane
* Stratified epithelia can have different shapes in different layers, they are categorized by the shape of the apical layer
* cells is simple squamous epithelium are flattened laterally, cytoplasm is sparse. Found where filtration or exchange of substances by rapid diffusion is priority (kidney, lungs)
* there are two special types of simple squamous epithelia
1. endothelium (lining of lymphatic vessels, blood vessels, heart). Derived from ectoderm and endoderm in early embryo
2. mesothelium (serous membranes in the ventral body cavity). Visceral layer covers the outside of organs, parietal layer lines the body cavity. Derived from mesoderm in early embryo. There is fluid between the two layers to allow organs to slide without friction
* Simple cuboidal epithelium is a single layer of cube like cells with large, spherical central nuclei. Functions in secretion and absorption. Found in kidney tubules, ducts and secretory portions of small glands, ovary surface
* ciliated simple cuboidal epithelium is found in the bronchioles of the lungs and uterine tubes
* Brionchioles are the small airways in the lungs that lead from the bronchi to the alveoli
* the cilia move mucus and debris out of the lungs
* scattered goblet cells secrete mucus that traps debris
* simple columnar epithelium is a single layer of tall cells with round to oval nuclei.
* They line the digestive tract from stomach to rectum, gallbladder, and excretory ducts of some glands
* function in absorption, secretion of mucus, enzymes, and other substances
* Secretory cells are often goblet cells, which produce mucus. Goblet cells secrete mucus into the digestive track
* Some simple columnar epithelia have cilia (ciliated simple columnar epithelium) which are found in the small bronchi, uterine tubes, and some regions of the uterus
* Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is a single layer of cells of differing heights, some not reaching the free surface, but all cells contact the basement membrane
* Can be ciliated (like in the respiratory tract) or non-ciliated (like in the sperm carrying ducts). There are also goblet cells that secrete mucus in this type of epithelium
* Stratified squamous epithelium is thick membrane composed of several cell layers. Basal cells are cuboidal or columnar and metabolically active. Surface cells are flattened (squamous). In the keratinized type the surface cells are full of keratin and dead. Found in areas subject to wear and tear (skin)
* Cells in the layers are replaced from below (basal layer)
* stratified squamous epithelium is the most common type of stratified epithelium. It is found in areas subject to wear and tear, such as the surfce of the skin, the lining of the mouth, and esophagus.
* Remember that the name comes from the most apical layer
* The outer layer of the skin is keratinized stratified squamous epithelium
* Non keratinized stratified squamous epithelium forms the moist linings of the esophagus, mouth, and vagina
* stratified cuboidal epithelium is rare and is found in some sweat and mammary glands. Typically two layers of cuboidal cells
* serves 2 purposes - protection and secretion
* stratified columnar epithelium is not cilliated, the basal layers are usually cuboidal. Found in the male urethra, pharynx, and lining some glandular ducts
* transitional epithelium is a special type of stratified epithelium found in the urinary bladder, ureters, and part of the urethra
* used as a permeable barrier to prevent diffusion of potentially toxic urine into the underlying tissues. Very resistant to osmotic pressure
* protected from drying out by uroplakins (specialized proteins)
* The second important function of these cells is the ability to stretch (like when the bladder fills with urine)
* number of layers changes with the degree of stretch
* glandular epithelium is a gland (one or more cells that makes and secretes an aqueous fluid called a secretion)
* classified by site of product release (endocrine or exocrine (lumen or actual outside of body)) and number of cells (unicellular or multicellular)
* Unicellular glands like goblet cells are scattered in the epithelial sheets
* Most multicellular glands form during development by inward growth (invagination) of an epithelial sheet into the underlying connective tissue
* exocrine glands keep the ducts that transport the secretion to the epithelial surface
* endocrine glands lose their ducts during development and secrete hormones into the interstitial fluid, which is picked up by the circulatory system
* For this reason endocrine glands are highly vascularized
* Exocrine glands include sweat glands, oil glands, salivary glands, ceruminous glands, lacrimal glands sebaceous glands, digestive glands, pancreas and liver.
* Only 2 important unicellular exocrine glands - goblet cells and mucous cells
* Both cell types secrete mucin, which is a highly glycosylated protein that forms mucus when dissolved in water, and forms slimy protective lubricating coating called mucus
* Multicellular exocrine glands are classified by structure (simple or compound) and the shape of the secretory unit (tubular, alveolar, or tubuloalveolar)
* exocrine glands can also be classified by their mode of secretion (merocrine, holocrine, apocrine)
* Merocrine secretion is the most common mode of secretion. The secretory cells secrete their products by exocytosis. Examples include pancreas, sweat glands, and salivary glands
* Holocrine secretion is when the secretory cells accumulate their products until they rupture. The whole cell dies and is the secretion. Example is sebaceous (oil) glands of the skin
* Apocrine secretion is when the apex of the cell pinches off and releases the secretory granules along with a small amount of cytoplasm. The cell then repairs itself and repeats the process. Example is mammary glands. Associated with hairy body regions like armpits and genital area

Lecture 3:

* Connective tissue has four main classes - connective tissue proper, cartilage, bone, blood
* Major functions of connective tissue - binding and support, protection, insulation, transportation (blood)
* Connective tissues all come from mesoderm
* varying degrees of vascularity (cartilage is avascular, dense connective tissue is poorly vascularized, other types have a rich supply of blood vessels)
* cells are suspended/embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM)
* All connective tissues have 3 main components - ground substance, fibers, cells
* The ground substance is unstructured material that fills the space between the cells and contains the fibers. It is composed of interstitial fluid, cell adhesion proteins, and proteoglycans (protein core + large polysaccharides)
* There are several types of connective tissue fibers - collagen (strongest and most abundant, tough, provides high tensile strength), elastic (long thin fibers that allow for stretch), reticular (short fine highly branched collagenous fibers, offer more "give")
* Collagen forms a triple helix of 3 identical alpha chains
* Elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin, which allows them to stretch and recoil like rubber bands.
* Reticular fibers are made of a different type of collagen (collagen III) and form a delicate network that covers and supports the structures bordering the connective tissue
* The ground substance and fibers together make up the extracellular matrix (ECM)
* Proteins that stick out of cells can be considrered part of the ECM
* Blast cells are immature form of cell that actively secretes ground substance and ECM fibers
* Fibroblasts in connective tissue proper
* Chondroblasts in cartilage
* Osteoblasts in bone
* Hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow
* Mature cells have a suffix -cyte and are less active in secreting ECM
* Other cell types in connective tissues include fat cells, white blood cells, mast cells (initiate local inflammatory response against foreign microorganisms they detect), macrophages (phagocytic cells that "eat" dead cells, microorganisms, etc. and activate the immune system when they sense foreign matter)
* Connective tissue proper has two subclasses - loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue
* Loose connective tissue has 3 types - areolar, adipose, reticular
* Dense connective tissue has 2 types - dense regular and dense irregular
* Areolar connective tissue contains fibroblast cells that contains loose arangements of mostly collagen fibers, some elastic fibers.
* this allows increased ground substance, which can act as a reservoir for water and salts for surrounding tissues (interstitial fluid)
* Almost all cells get their nutrients from and release their wastes into this "tissue fluid"
* Most widely distributed connective tissue
* Functions as universal packing material between other tissues
* Found surrounding capillaries, muscles, organs
* Fills spaces between organs
* Forms the lamina propria of mucous membranes
* Areolar tissue holds organs in place and attaches epithelial tissue to underlying tissues
* Macrophages and fat cells can be found in areolar tissue
* Adipose tissue is similar to areolar tissue but with more nutrient storing ability, has very little matrix
* Adipocytes account for 90% of the mass of adipose tissue
* The matrix separates the fat cells
* The nucleus is pushed to the side by a large fat droplet
* Richly vascularized
* Adipose tissue functions in nutrient storage, shock absorption, insulation, and protection
* Adipose tissue is found under the skin (subcutaneous fat), around kidneys and eyeballs, within abdomen (visceral fat), in breasts
* There are two types of adipose tissue - white fat (stores nutrients, acts as shock absorber and insulator) and brown fat (use lipid fuels to heat bloodstream not to produce ATP, found in babies and children)
* Brown fat is brown because it contains many mitochondria
* Brown fat helps new borns maintain their body temperature
* Reticular connective tissues resembles areolar tissue but the only fibers in the matrix are reticular fibers (no coollagen or elastic fibers)
* In this tissue type the fibroblasts are called reticular cells
* These cells secrete reticular fibers made of thin collagen
* In reticular connective tissue these thin fibers form a mesh-like stroma (supportive framework) that acts as a support for blood cells in lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow
* Reticular fibers are found in other connective tissue types as well
* Provides a soft bedding for cells to sit on
* Dense connective tissue contains more collagen than loose connective tissue
* Regular dense connective tissue contains closely packed bundles of collagen fibers running in the same direction, parallel to the direction of pull
* This arrangement produces flexible structures with high tensile strength
* Dense regular connective tissue resists strectch but can stretch a little due to crimped collagen fibers
* Once the fibers straighten out there is little more stretch
* Between the collagen fibers are rows of fibroblasts that manufacture the building blocks of the fibers
* there are few cells compared to the amount of collagen
* Forms tendons (muscle to bone), ligaments (bone to bone), and aponeuroses (muscle to muscle or muscle to bone)
* Tendons are fibrous cords of dense regular connective tissue that attach muscles to bones
* Ligaments are short bands of tough dense regular connective tissue that connect one bone to another bone
* Aponeuroses are flat, sheetlike tendons that attach muscles to other muscles or to bones
* Poorly vascularized so healing is slow
* Very little turnover of collagen fibers after the age of 17/18
* Dense irregular connective tissue has bundles of collagen fibers that are thicker and irregularly arranged
* The fibers form sheets rather than bundles
* Greater strength in all directions but less strength in one particular direction compared to dense regular connective tissue
* Sometimes fiber criss cross and form a mesh
* Found in areas where tension is exerted from many different directions
* Found in dermis of skin, fibrous joint capsules, fibrous coverings of some organs (kidney, bone, cartilage, muscles, nerves) and forms the fibrous layer of the perichondrium
* Dense regular elastic connective tissue is a modified dense regular connective tissue with a high proportion of elastic fibers
* Elastic fibers allow the tissue to recoil after stretching
* The walls of the lungs and large arteries need to stretch as blood is pumped through them and then recoil to help propel the blood onward into the circulation
* allows certain ligaments like those connective adjacent vertebrae to be very elastic
* Cartilage has 3 types - hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage
* Cartilage is a firm but flexible tissue, and is avascular
* Cartillage is 80 % water and packed with collagen fibers and sugar proteins (chondroitin and hyaluronic acid)
* Chondroblasts are the matrix secreting cells found in developing cartilage
* In adults mature cartilage chondrocytes (mature chondroblasts) lie in lacunae (small cavities) in the matrix they have made
* Hyaline cartilage is the most abundant cartilage type in the body
* It is translucent with a bluish-white glassy appearance
* Contains many collagen fibers, making it firm
* Found at the tip of the nose, supports the respitoratory passages, covers the ends of long bones as articular cartilage, connects ribs to sternum, and makes up most of the embryonic skeleton
* Articular cartilage is a type of hyaline cartilage that covers the ends of bones where they form joints
* During childhood epiphyseal plates (growth plates) are made of hyaline cartilage that allows for growth of long bones
* Elastic cartilage contains more elastic fibers than hyaline cartilage, making it more flexible
* Found in the external ear and epiglottis
* Fibrocartilage is a highly compressible cartilage with great tensile strength
* Strongest type of cartilage
* Found in areas such as the menisci of the knee and the intervertebral discs
* Bone is a living tissue that is vascularized and composed mainly of collagen fibers and inorganic calcium salts
* Hardness of bone is due to the inorganic calcium salts
* Hard outer layer is called compact bone
* Spongy bone is found inside the bone
* This bone matrix is organized into structural units called osteoids
* Osteoid is the unminaeralized bone matrix, formed prior to the maturation of bone tissue
* An osteoid is composed of collagen fibers and ground substance
* Soon after the osteod forms, calcium salts are deposited on and around the osteoid, which hardens the matrix
* Bone has several functions - support, protection, movement, mineral storage (calcium and phosphorus), blood cell formation (hematopoiesis occurs in the red marrow of certain bones)
* Bone cells include osteoblasts (bone forming cells), osteocytes (mature bone cells), osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells)
* The last type of connective tissue is blood
* Blood does not support or connect things, but functions as an internal transportation system for nutrients, wastes, gases, and other substances
* Blood is classified as a connective tissue because it develops from mesenchyme and consists of blood cells surrounded by a nonliving fluid matrix called blood plasma
* Blood has cells that include red blood cells (erythrocytes, transport oxygen), white blood cells (leukocytes, immune response), and platelets (cell fragments involved in clotting)
* The fibers in blood are soluble proteins that precipitate during blood clotting

Lecture 4:

* The plasma membrane is a flexible membrane that seperates the intracellular fluid (ICF) inside the cell from the extracellular fluid (ECF) outside the cell
* Highly selective barrier that maintains the environment of the cell
* Composed of the lipid bilayer, composed of 2 layers of lipids arranged into a hollow sphere
* The lipid bilyaer consists mostly of phospholipids, with some cholesterol and glycolipids
* The charged polar heads of the phospholipids are hydrophilic (water loving) and face the watery environment inside and outside the cell
* The uncharged nonpolar tails are hydrophobic (water fearing) and face each other on the inside of the membrane
* 5 percent of the membrane lipids are glycolipids (lipids with sugar groups on the polar head)
* 20 percent of the membrane lipids are cholesterol, which has a polar region (hydroxyl group) and a nonpolar region (fused ring system)
* Cholersterol decreases the fluidity of the membrane and increases its stability
* Cholesterol frms specialized lipid islands called lipid rafts where signaling molecules congregate
* * Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules (have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions)
* The structure of the phospholipid bilayer results in selective permeability (some molecules can pass through, others cannot)
* The membrane is impermeable to most water-soluble molecules (glucose, proteins, ions)
* Bilayer of the naturally occuring phospholipids is fluid, not solid
* The fatty acids of most phospholipids have one or more double bonds (unsaturated) which makes the membrane more fluid
* The long hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids are flexible and can move around
* Phospholipids and proteins are free to move laterally in the membrane
* While lipids are the fundamental structural components of the membrane, proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions
* 1 protein molecule for every 50-100 lipid molecules
* The fluid mosaic model describes the membrane as a fluid structure with a "mosaic" of various proteins embedded in or attached to a bilayer of phospholipids
* Integral proteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer, most are transmembrane proteins (span the entire membrane)
* Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer, they are loosely attached to the integral proteins or to the polar heads of the phospholipids
* Membrane proteins are unable to flip back and forth across the membrane because the hydrophobic regions would be exposed to water
* Fluorence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a technique used to study the movement of proteins in the membrane
* A specific region of the membrane is bleached with a laser, and the time it takes for unbleached fluorescent molecules to move back into the bleached area is measured
* Some membrane proteins are anchored to the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix, which restricts their movement
* This can be regulated so some proteins are free to move while others are anchored
* There are two major types of membrane proteins - integral and peripheral
* Integral proteins generally have hydrophobic regions formed by stretches of nonpolar amino acids that interact with the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids and hydrophilic regions formed by charged polar amino acids that face the aqueous environment on either side of the membrane
* Many integral proteins are transmembrane proteins that span the entire membrane and protrude on both sides
* These proteins can be visible with an electron microscope when the membrane is viewed in cross section
* Integral proteins have many functions - transport, enzymatic activity, receptors.
* Peripheral membrane proteins bind to integral proteins or to polar heads of phospholipids
* Peripheral mebrane proteins include cytoskeletal proteins that support the membrane from the cytoplasmic side, and some are enzymes
* A good example is spectrin, a peripheral protein that lines the intracellular side of the membrane in red blood cells
* peripheral proteins can function as enzymes or scaffolds to support the membrane
* Some transmebrane protein have hydrophilic channels that are selective for a particular solute
* Other transmembrane proteins use ATP to actively pump substances across the membrane (often across the concentration gradient)
* Another function is communication between inside and outside of the cell
* Some proteins have a binding site that fits the shape of a specific chemical messenger (like a hormone), which often changes the shape of the protein so it can relay the message to the inside of the cell
* Functions: transport, signaling, enzyme activity, attachment, adhesion, cell-cell recognition
* In cell recogniztion the highly charged branch carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins and glycolipids form a sugary coating called the glycocalyx
* The composition of the glycocalyx is unique to cell types so it functions as a specific biological marker for cell to cell recognition
* bacteria have their own glycocalyx that helps them adhere to surfaces and evade the immune system
* There are two major types of membrane transport processes - passive and active
* Passive processes (like diffusion) are driven by the kinetic energy of the molecules and do not require ATP
* Active processes (like active transport) require ATP to move solutes across the membrane
* In diffusion molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration (down the concentration gradient)
* In simple diffusion the molecules diffuse directly through the lipid bilayer, which is selectively permeable
* Small nonpolar lipid soluble molecules (like oxygen, carbon dioxide, steroid hormones, and fat soluble vitamins) diffuse directly through the membrane
* Substances that are larger, not lipid soluble, or charged (like glucose, ions, and water) need help to cross the membrane
* In facilitated diffusion the molecules are transported by a carrier protein or channel
* There are two types of facilitated diffusion - carrier mediated and channel mediated
* In carrier mediated facilitated diffusion a transmembrane protein changes shape to move the molecule across the membrane
* Used for certain hydrophilic molecules (like glucose, amino acids, and some ions)
* This is done passively, down the concentration gradient. A binding molecule attaches to the carrier protein, which changes shape and releases the molecule on the other side of the membrane
* Generally slower than channel mediated facilitated diffusion
* In channel mediated facilitated diffusion a transmembrane protein forms a channel that allows a specific molecule or ion to cross the membrane
* Channels can be leakage channels (always open) or gated channels (controlled by chemical or electrical signals)
* Water moves through the membrane by osmosis, which is the diffusion of a solvent (like water) through a selectively permeable membrane
* Water is a solvent, and solutes are substances dissolved in the solvent
* Diffusion of water across the plasma membrane occurs when there is an unequal concentration of solutes on the two sides of the membrane
* Osmosis is the special name for the movement of a solvent (like water) across a selectively permeable membrane
* Solvent + solute = solution
* Osmolarity is the number of solute particles dissolved in a solution
* case 1: Membrane is permeable to both solute and solvent - both solute and solvent move down their concentration gradients until equilibrium is reached. Volume remains the same on both sides.
* case 2: Membrane is permeable to solvent but not solute - solvent moves down its concentration gradient until equilibrium is reached. Volume changes on both sides.
* Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent osmosis. The greater the concentration of solutes in a solution, the greater the osmotic pressure
* In other words, the more solutes in a solution, the more water wants to move into that solution by osmosis, increasing the volume of the more concentrated solution. No change in volume occurs when the membrane is permeable to both solute and solvent
* Only non penetrating solutes (like large molecules and ions) contribute to osmotic pressure because they cannot cross the membrane
* when considering if solutes in a solution with affect cell volume, only non penetrating solutes are considered
* Osmolarity refers to the total concentration of all solute particles in a solution, both penetrating and non penetrating
* Hyperosmotic, isoosmotic, and hyposmotic refer to the total concentration of all solute particles in a solution compared to the inside of the cell
* Hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic refer to the concentration of non penetrating solutes in a solution compared to the inside of the cell
* Na+, cl-, and proteins are the major non penetrating solutes in the body
* Osmolarity of body fluids is about 300 mOsm
* A 1L solution of 300 mOsm NaCl (np) and 100 mOsm urea (p) is hyperosmotic (400 mOsm) but isotonic to a cell because the concentration of non penetrating solutes is the same as inside the cell (300 mOsm)
* Cells in isotonic solutions retain their normal size and shape
* Cells in hypertonic solutions lose water by osmosis and shrink (crenate)
* Cells in hypotonic solutions take on water by osmosis until they become bloated and burst (lyse)
